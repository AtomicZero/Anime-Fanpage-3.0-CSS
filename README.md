# Anime Fanpage 3.0

This is my anime fanpage. Just to practice some of the basic CSS elements:
* Parallax [3 wallpapers link at bottom]
* Flexbox positioning
* Animation [glowing text]
* Box shading
* Text scrolling [Marquee]
* Hover Animation
* Text colouring & shadowing
* Google Font Styles
* In-Line Styling
* CSS Stylesheets


## User Story
* I wanted to create an anime website that had multiple pages instead of one long page where you had to scroll a lot and the pages should have styled pagination
* I wanted my page to talk about my history with anime, how long I have been watching it, and describe some of the main categories and genres found in anime. Which should be styled in floating boxes
* My page should be in semantic HTML and I also wanted my webpage to have working links to some of my favourite anime websites
* My page should also have a video of the Cowboy Bebop opening theme song
* I wanted my anime page to also have a list of some of my favourite anime titles and for there to be some images. This list should not just be a boring table, but a fun interactive way
* All images on my page will have an alt attribute.
* I wanted to have fun text animation and effects like glowing and scrolling
* I wanted my landing page to be a spashy CSS scroll effect
* I wanted the page to also have a favicon
